# Patient-Triage
Assignment #3 - Patient Triage


Imagine your local ER needs an application that manages their triage list.

New patients are constantly entering the ER so they need to be able to add patient names to the list. 

Some patients get fed up with the wait time and leave, so they need to be able to delete patients from the list. 

Occasionally a patient name in entered incorectly, so they need to be able to update a name on the list. 

And often a patient get sicker during their wait and needs to be switched with a patient higher up on the list, so they need to be able to reorder the list. 

Using the `patientList` in the starter code, create all of the following funcionality based on the command entered by the user:

1. If the user typed in 'add', prompt them for a patient name, add that patient to the list, and display the list. 

2. If the user typed in 'update', prompt them for a patient name,  prompt them for a new name, update the name to the new name, and display the list. 

3. If the user typed in 'delete', prompt them for a patient name, delete that patient, and display the list.

4. If the user typed in 'reorder', prompt them for a patient name, prompt them for another patient name, switch the two entered patients, and display the list.

HINT: Before you begin, make sure to create a flowchart to keep your ideas organized.
